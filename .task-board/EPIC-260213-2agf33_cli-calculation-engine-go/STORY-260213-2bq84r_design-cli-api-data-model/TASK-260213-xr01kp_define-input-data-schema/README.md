## Description
Define JSON input schema for product/bundle evaluation data. Schema must support: product definition (name, price, components with standalone prices), tier definitions (entry/middle/premium with features), competitor data (products with feature-by-feature comparison), customer metrics (churn, NPS, CSAT responses, conversion data), financial data (costs, margins, revenue). Schema should be flexible enough for any industry (not telecom-specific).

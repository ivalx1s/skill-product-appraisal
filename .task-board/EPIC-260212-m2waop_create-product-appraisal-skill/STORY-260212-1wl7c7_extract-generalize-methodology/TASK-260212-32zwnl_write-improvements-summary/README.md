# TASK-260212-32zwnl: write-improvements-summary

## Description
After factcheck, write a summary document with: (a) what was verified and confirmed, (b) what was flagged as incorrect/hallucinated/outdated and how it was corrected, (c) proposed improvements to the methodology based on factcheck findings — new benchmarks found, better sources, updated thresholds, missing frameworks worth adding. This becomes the changelog/rationale for the generalized skill vs the original telecom-specific version. Store in .research/ or artifacts.

## Scope
(define task scope)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Summary covers: confirmed claims (with sources), corrected claims (what changed and why), removed claims (no source found), proposed improvements. 2. Stored in .research/improvements-summary.md. 3. Actionable — each improvement has clear instruction for what to change in the skill files.

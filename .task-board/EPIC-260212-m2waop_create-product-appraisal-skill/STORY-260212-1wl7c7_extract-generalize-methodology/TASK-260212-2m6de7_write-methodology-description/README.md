# TASK-260212-2m6de7: write-methodology-description

## Description
After improvements summary, write a concise methodology description and put it in the project root (METHODOLOGY.md). Not a full academic paper — a practical 'how we evaluated' doc: what was assessed, how each dimension was measured, what benchmarks/thresholds were used, what angle/lens was applied. Think of it as 'this is how we looked at things' — so anyone picking up the skill understands the reasoning behind the assessment criteria. Sections: (a) evaluation dimensions and what each measures, (b) key metrics and how they're calculated, (c) benchmarks and where they come from, (d) the evaluation logic flow (demand → pricing → bundle → competitive → financial → CX → regional → go/no-go).

## Scope
(define task scope)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. METHODOLOGY.md in project root. 2. Covers all 7 dimensions with plain-language explanation of what each measures and how. 3. Lists key metrics with calculation method. 4. References benchmarks with sources. 5. Shows evaluation logic flow. 6. Readable by someone who hasn't seen the skill internals.

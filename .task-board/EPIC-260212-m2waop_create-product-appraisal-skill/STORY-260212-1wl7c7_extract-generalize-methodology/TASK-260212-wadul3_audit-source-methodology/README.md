# TASK-260212-wadul3: audit-source-methodology

## Description
Read all 4 methodology docs from MTS research project at /Users/aagrigore1/src/mts-tariff-research/.research/:
- 260212_methodology-framework.md (639 lines — unified evaluation lens)
- 260212_bundle-valuation-methods.md (565 lines — bundle theory, WTP, case studies)
- 260212_telecom-assessment-frameworks.md (760 lines — assessment frameworks)
- 260212_telecom-pricing-methodologies.md (700 lines — pricing methods)

Catalog every framework, method, metric, and benchmark into three buckets:
(a) Universal — transfers 1:1 to any complex product (bundle theory, GBB, WTP methods, Leaders/Fillers/Killers, dead weight, cross-subsidy)
(b) Adaptable — structure is universal but KPIs/thresholds need industry replacement (7 assessment dimensions, KPI tables)
(c) Telecom-only — does not transfer (ARPU, Revenue per GB, roaming analysis, FAS regulation, prepaid/postpaid)

Output: .research/audit-inventory.md

## Scope
(define task scope)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All 4 source docs fully read. 2. Every framework/method/metric categorized into universal/adaptable/telecom-only. 3. Inventory stored in .research/audit-inventory.md. 4. No frameworks missed — cross-check TOCs of all 4 docs.

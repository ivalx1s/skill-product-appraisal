# Create Product Appraisal Skill

## Description
Generalize the telecom tariff assessment methodology into a universal skill for evaluating any complex product/bundle on a market. Extract frameworks from MTS HVPC research, remove industry-specific elements, create reusable assessment criteria, pricing methods, bundle valuation tools, and KPI catalog.

## Scope
SKILL.md + references (assessment-criteria, bundle-valuation, pricing-methods, kpi-catalog) + global symlinks

## Acceptance Criteria
1. SKILL.md with proper frontmatter and core workflow. 2. Generalized assessment criteria (7 dimensions). 3. Bundle valuation reference (Leaders/Fillers/Killers, dead weight, cross-subsidy). 4. Pricing methods reference (GBB, WTP, anchoring). 5. KPI catalog (universal, not telecom-specific). 6. Symlinked to ~/.claude/skills/ and ~/.codex/skills/. 7. Validated with package-skill.sh.

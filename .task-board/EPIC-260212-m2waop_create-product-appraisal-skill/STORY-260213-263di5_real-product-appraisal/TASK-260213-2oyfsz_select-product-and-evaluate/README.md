# TASK-260213-2oyfsz: select-product-and-evaluate

## Description
Evaluate a specific product using the product-appraisal skill methodology:

PRODUCT: Bosch Laser Rangefinder 100m, 1.5mm accuracy, 1/4" mount, IP54
PRICE: ~10,000 RUB
SOURCE: https://www.ozon.ru/product/bosch-lazernyy-dalnomer-100-m-1-5-mm-1-4-ip-54-2701078882/

Run the full product-appraisal methodology:
1. Research the product specs, features, included accessories
2. Research competitors in the same category (other laser rangefinders: Leica, DeWalt, Makita, ADA, Chinese brands like SNDWAY/Mileseey)
3. Evaluate across applicable dimensions from the 7-dimension framework (not all dimensions may apply to a physical tool — adapt as needed)
4. Fill the scorecard using evaluation-template.md from the skill
5. Price-value positioning vs competitors
6. Recommendations

Note: This is a PHYSICAL TOOL, not a subscription/bundle. This tests whether the methodology adapts beyond subscription products. Some dimensions (Bundle Composition, potentially Regional) may need reinterpretation or may not apply.

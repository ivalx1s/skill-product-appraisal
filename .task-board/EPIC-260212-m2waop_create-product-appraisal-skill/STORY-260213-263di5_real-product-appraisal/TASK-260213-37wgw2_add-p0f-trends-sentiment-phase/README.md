# TASK-260213-37wgw2: add-p0f-trends-sentiment-phase

## Description
Add P0f: Trends & Sentiment as a new sub-phase inside Phase 0.

PLACEMENT: P0f runs in Wave 1 alongside P0a/P0b/P0c/P0e. One agent. P0d synthesis merges trend data into p0-research.md.

WHY SEPARATE FROM P0c: P0c covers market structure (size, segments, pricing landscape, distribution, regulatory). P0f covers the dynamic layer — what's changing, what people are talking about, where the category is heading. Different research methodology (social listening, forums, YouTube, blogs vs market reports).

P0f AGENT SCOPE:
1. Consumer sentiment — what buyers are saying on forums, Reddit, YouTube reviews, social media. Common praise/complaints about the product category. Shifting expectations (e.g. "everyone wants USB-C now")
2. Technology trends — emerging tech that affects the category (e.g. LiDAR in phones killing standalone rangefinders, AI-assisted measurement, BIM integration). New features becoming table stakes
3. Industry direction — analyst predictions, trade show highlights, manufacturer roadmaps if public. Where is the category heading in 2-3 years
4. Purchase behavior shifts — online vs offline trend, subscription/rental models, refurbished market growth, D2C vs retail
5. Social proof & influencer landscape — key reviewers/channels that shape opinion in this category, viral moments, brand perception shifts
6. Sustainability & regulatory trends — eco-certifications, right-to-repair, packaging regulations, supply chain shifts

OUTPUT: {slug}-p0f-trends.md
SIZE TARGET: 80-120 lines.

DOWNSTREAM IMPACT:
- P1 (PMF): trend alignment validates segment demand
- P3 (Bundle): trends reveal which features are becoming table stakes vs differentiators
- P4 (Competitive): trend awareness shows who's ahead/behind the curve
- P6 (CX): sentiment data feeds satisfaction assessment
- P7 (Market Reach): trend adoption varies by region
- P8 (Scoring): trend misalignment = risk factor

FILES TO UPDATE (together with TASK-260213-2arkw6):
- evaluation-phases.md: add P0f, update P0d to include trend synthesis
- SKILL.md: update phase references

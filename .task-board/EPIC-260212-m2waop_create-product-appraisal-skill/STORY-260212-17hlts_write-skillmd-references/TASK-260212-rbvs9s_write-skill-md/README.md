# TASK-260212-rbvs9s: write-skill-md

## Description
Write SKILL.md: frontmatter (name, description with multi-language triggers), core evaluation workflow, 7 dimensions overview, progressive disclosure links to references. Under 500 lines.

CORE RULE — source attribution for product data: When evaluating products using this skill, every product characteristic (price, features, specs, included services, terms) must have a reference to the source (official website, tariff page, press release, review site, etc). No 'Product X costs Y and includes Z' without a link. This is a fundamental quality requirement of the methodology — unsourced product data is unreliable and makes the entire analysis unverifiable. Include this as a prominent rule in SKILL.md workflow section.

## Scope
(define task scope)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. SKILL.md under 500 lines. 2. Frontmatter with name + description (EN + RU triggers). 3. Core workflow section with evaluation logic flow. 4. Source attribution rule prominently placed. 5. Progressive disclosure links to all 4 reference files. 6. 7 dimensions overview (brief — details in references).

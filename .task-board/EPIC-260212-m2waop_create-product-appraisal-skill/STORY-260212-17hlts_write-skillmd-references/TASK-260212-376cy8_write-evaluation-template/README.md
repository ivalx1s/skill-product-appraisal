# TASK-260212-376cy8: write-evaluation-template

## Description
Create references/evaluation-template.md — a ready-to-fill template that agents use when evaluating a product with this skill. Sections matching the 7 dimensions, with placeholders for: product name, market context, assessment scores, key metrics, sources. Think of it as a structured output format — agent reads the skill, fills the template, delivers the evaluation. Also include a condensed scorecard template (1-page go/no-go summary).

## Scope
(define task scope)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Template covers all 7 dimensions with fill-in sections. 2. Includes scorecard (1-page go/no-go). 3. Source attribution placeholders built in. 4. Usable as-is — agent can copy and fill without modification.

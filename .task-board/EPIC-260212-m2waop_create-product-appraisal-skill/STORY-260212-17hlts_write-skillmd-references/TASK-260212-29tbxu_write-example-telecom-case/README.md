# TASK-260212-29tbxu: write-example-telecom-case

## Description
Create references/example-telecom-appraisal.md — a condensed example of how the product appraisal methodology was applied to a fictional telecom operator's premium tariff lineup. NOT a copy of the real report — a restructured walkthrough that demonstrates the methodology.

ANONYMIZATION & MODIFICATION:
- The EVALUATED PRODUCT is fictional: generic operator name ('Operator A'), modified prices (shift 10-20%), modified bundle composition (swap real services for plausible fictional ones — 'Video Platform', 'Sports Club Chain', 'Restaurant Network'), altered feature sets (different minutes/GB/SMS)
- COMPETITORS can stay real — MegaFon, T2, Beeline, Yota are public data from open sources. Their tariffs and prices are publicly available and don't need anonymization
- Keep the STRUCTURE and METHODOLOGY real — the point is to show HOW the evaluation works
- The evaluated product should feel realistic but NOT be identifiable as the actual case

Source for methodology structure: /Users/aagrigore1/src/mts-tariff-research/REPORT.md and SUMMARY.md. Use as inspiration for structure only — change the evaluated product's data.

Sections:
(a) Product overview (3-tier premium lineup — fictional operator, modified prices, modified components)
(b) Dimension-by-dimension walkthrough (1 paragraph + key metric per dimension)
(c) Filled scorecard (go/no-go for each dimension with rationale)
(d) Key recommendations (top 3-5)
(e) Lessons learned (what this case teaches about applying the methodology)

## Scope
(define task scope)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Condensed to 200-300 lines. 2. All 7 dimensions covered with plausible data. 3. Filled scorecard included. 4. ZERO real product/company names or identifiable data. 5. Not reverse-engineerable to actual case. 6. Shows the methodology in action clearly.

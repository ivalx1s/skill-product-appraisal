## 1. Academic Frameworks

### Adams-Yellen (1976) -- Bundling Theory
**Claim:** Formalized bundling as price discrimination; pure/mixed/component bundling; reservation prices sorting.
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Source:** Adams, W.J. & Yellen, J.L. (1976). "Commodity Bundling and the Burden of Monopoly." *Quarterly Journal of Economics*, 90(3), 475-498.
**URL:** https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/90/3/475/1854397

### Schmalensee (1984) -- Variance Reduction
**Claim:** Bundling reduces variance of consumer valuations; works even with positively correlated valuations; law of large numbers reduces coefficient of variation.
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Source:** Schmalensee, R. (1984). "Gaussian Demand and Commodity Bundling." *Journal of Business*, 57(1), S211-S230.
**URL:** https://www.jstor.org/stable/2352937

### McAfee, McMillan & Whinston (1989) -- Mixed Bundling Optimality
**Claim:** Mixed bundling almost always strictly increases profits vs. pure bundling or component selling.
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Source:** McAfee, R.P., McMillan, J. & Whinston, M.D. (1989). "Multiproduct Monopoly, Commodity Bundling, and Correlation of Values." *Quarterly Journal of Economics*, 104(2), 371-383.
**URL:** https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/104/2/371/1854649

### Tversky & Kahneman -- Anchoring Effect
**Claim:** First price seen strongly influences fairness perception. "Displaying standalone prices increases perceived bundle value by approximately 32%."
**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED
- Tversky & Kahneman's anchoring work (1974, "Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases") is verified.
- The specific "32%" figure for bundle perceived value increase from displaying standalone prices could not be traced to a specific Tversky/Kahneman paper. It appears in secondary marketing sources but without primary attribution.
**Action:** Reword as "Price anchoring research shows that displaying individual component prices alongside the bundle price significantly increases perceived value" -- remove the unattributed 32% figure.

### Wansink -- Bundle Framing "3 for $5"
**Claim:** "3 for $5" framing vs. $1.67 each boosted sales by 32%.
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Source:** Brian Wansink's multi-unit pricing research. Referenced in Scribd study notes and multiple pricing psychology sources.
**URL:** https://www.scribd.com/document/895589393/Wansink-Study-Simplified-Notes
**Note:** The original paper is Wansink, B., Kent, R.J. & Hoch, S.J. (1998). "An Anchoring and Adjustment Model of Purchase Quantity Decisions." *Journal of Marketing Research*, 35(1), 71-81.

### Blut et al. (2024) -- Customer Perceived Value Meta-analysis
**Claim:** 687 articles, 780 samples, 357,247 customers; three dimensions (benefits, sacrifices, overall value).
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Source:** Blut, M., Chaney, D., Lunardo, R., Mencarelli, R. & Grewal, D. (2024). "Customer Perceived Value: A Comprehensive Meta-analysis." *Journal of Service Research*, 27(4), 501-524.
**URL:** https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10946705231222295

### Xia Wei, Yu & Li (2025) -- Perceived Heterogeneity and Bundle Pricing
**Claim:** Heterogeneous bundles support higher prices; variety signals value.
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Source:** Xia Wei, Yu, S. & Li, X. (2025). "Price it High if it is Varied: Perceived Heterogeneity and the Effectiveness of Discount Framing Strategies for Travel Packages." *Journal of Travel Research*.
**URL:** https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00472875231222263
**Note:** Published 2024/2025 (online first 2024).

### Shaddy & Fishbach -- Bundling Affects Valuation (Dilution Effect)
**Claim:** Bundling expensive + inexpensive items can lower perceived value below the expensive item alone.
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Source:** Shaddy, F. & Fishbach, A. (2017). "Seller Beware: How Bundling Affects Valuation." *Journal of Marketing Research*. UCLA Anderson / Chicago Booth.
**URL:** https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/documents/areas/fac/marketing/Seminars/Fall%202017/Shaddy%20%20Fishbach%20-%20How%20Bundling%20Affects%20Valuation%20(job%20market%20paper).pdf
**Note:** The finding is about asymmetric valuation -- consumers pay less for items added to bundles but demand more compensation for items removed from bundles. The "dilution" interpretation is directionally correct but the paper's mechanism is more nuanced (gestalt effect).

### Luo (2023) -- Bundling in Telecom (Unbundling Losses)
**Claim:** Unbundling leads to 10.14% profit decrease and 17.18% consumer surplus decrease.
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Source:** Luo, Y. (2023). "Bundling and nonlinear pricing in telecommunications." *RAND Journal of Economics*, 54(2), 268-298.
**URL:** https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1756-2171.12437
**Note:** These are telecom-specific empirical results, not universal benchmarks. In generalized methodology, cite as "empirical research in one industry found..." rather than as universal thresholds.

### Prince & Greenstein -- Service Bundling and Churn
**Claim:** Fixed broadband bundled subscribers stay 6.93 years vs. 6.15 years without bundles.
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Source:** Prince, J. & Greenstein, S. (2014). "Does Service Bundling Reduce Churn?" *Journal of Economics & Management Strategy*.
**URL:** https://host.kelley.iu.edu/riharbau/RePEc/iuk/wpaper/bepp2011-05-prince-greenstein.pdf
**Note:** Authors characterize the churn reduction as "modest." Mobile subscribers: 6.43 vs. 5.89 years.

## 2. Industry/Consulting Benchmarks

### McKinsey: Bundling increases revenues 10-30%
**Claim:** Effective bundling strategies increase revenues by 10-30%.
**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED
- The 10-30% range appears in secondary sources citing McKinsey but no specific McKinsey publication with this exact figure was found.
- McKinsey's documented personalization research shows "10-15% revenue lift" from personalization (not bundling specifically).
**Action:** Reword as "Industry research suggests effective bundling strategies can increase revenues by 10-30%" -- remove specific McKinsey attribution unless primary source found. Alternatively, use McKinsey's verified "10-15% revenue lift from personalization."
**URL (McKinsey personalization):** https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying

### HBR: Mixed bundling outperforms pure bundling by 25-35%
**Claim:** Mixed bundling outperforms pure bundling by 25-35% in revenue generation.
**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED
- HBR has published on bundling (Rafi Mohammed, 2018, "The Good-Better-Best Approach to Pricing"; HBS working paper "The Dynamic Effects of Bundling as a Product Strategy" by Stremersch & Tellis).
- The specific "25-35%" figure appears in secondary aggregation sources but not directly traceable to a single HBR article.
**Action:** Reword as "Research shows mixed bundling typically outperforms pure bundling in revenue generation" -- cite McAfee-McMillan-Whinston (1989) for the theoretical proof and remove unverifiable percentage.
**URL (HBR Good-Better-Best):** https://hbr.org/2018/09/the-good-better-best-approach-to-pricing

### BCG: Bundles perceived as 20-25% more valuable than sum of parts
**Claim:** Well-constructed bundles are perceived as 20-25% more valuable than the sum of their individual parts.
**Status:** UNVERIFIABLE
- No BCG publication found with this specific claim. Secondary sources reference "BCG" but no primary URL.
**Action:** Remove BCG attribution. Reword as "Research suggests well-constructed bundles can be perceived as more valuable than the sum of their parts, though the magnitude varies by product category and consumer segment."

### Simon-Kucher: ~40% neutral-to-low interest in VAS; 13% convert with swappable benefits
**Claim:** ~40% of customers show neutral to low interest in any given free VAS; 13% convert when offered swappable benefits.
**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED
- Simon-Kucher's 2024 Global Telecommunications Study is real and documented.
- The "60% respond positively to free additional benefits" was found (inverse of ~40% neutral/negative).
- The specific "13% swappable conversion" was not found in accessible search results.
**Source:** https://www.simon-kucher.com/en/insights/2024-telco-growth-strategies-brand-portfolio-and-pricing-insights
**Action:** Keep the "~40% neutral to low interest" (derived from the verified 60% positive). Flag "13% swappable conversion" as unverifiable -- reword as "offering swappable benefits converts a portion of initially disinterested customers" without specific percentage.

### Simon-Kucher: Price-value ratio declined 7% in 2024
**Claim:** 7% decline in price-value ratio for telco in 2024.
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Source:** Simon-Kucher Global Telecommunications Study 2024.
**URL:** https://www.simon-kucher.com/en/insights/2024-telco-growth-strategies-brand-portfolio-and-pricing-insights
**Note:** This is telecom-specific. In generalized methodology, note as an example of industry value erosion, not a universal benchmark.

### Simon-Kucher: 43% of consumers reduced telco spending
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Source:** Same as above.
**Note:** Telecom-specific statistic. Not transferable as universal benchmark.

### Simon-Kucher: Leaders / Fillers / Killers Framework
**Claim:** Simon-Kucher framework for classifying bundle components.
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Source:** Simon-Kucher publications on telco marketing and bundling strategy.
**URL:** https://www.simon-kucher.com/en/insights/future-proof-telco-marketing-6-strategies-best-practices

### Simon-Kucher: ICE Model (Image, Communication, Execution)
**Claim:** Brand assessment framework with three levers: Image, Communication, Execution.
**Status:** UNVERIFIABLE
- No Simon-Kucher publication found documenting this specific framework by name.

## 3. Pricing and Behavioral Benchmarks

### GBB Distribution: ~20% / ~66% / ~14%
**Claim:** Three-tier pricing leads to approximately 20% choosing low, 66% choosing middle, 14% choosing high.
**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED
- The 66% middle-tier finding is widely cited in pricing literature (Channel Dynamics, IdeaFloat, Wikipedia).
- One source gives: high 11%, medium 66%, low 23%.
- Rafi Mohammed (HBR 2018) gives different ranges: 10-20% Good, 25-50% Better, 30-60% Best.
**Action:** The exact 20/66/14 split is one version. More accurate: "Research consistently shows the majority (60-70%) of customers choose the middle tier." The specific percentage varies by study. Use "~66% middle tier" as a general heuristic, not a precise figure.
**URL:** https://hbr.org/2018/09/the-good-better-best-approach-to-pricing

### Removing middle tier: 48-60% revenue reduction
**Claim:** Removing the middle tier reduces revenue by 48-60%.
**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED
- Multiple secondary sources cite this range.
- One source notes SaaS businesses generate 60-70% of recurring revenue from mid-tier subscriptions, which is consistent.
- No primary academic paper found for the specific 48-60% figure.
**Action:** Keep as "industry sources suggest removing the middle tier can reduce revenue by approximately 50%" -- soften the precision.

### Bundle Value Ratio threshold: >1.5x adequate, >2.0x strong
**Claim:** BVR >1.5x is adequate, >2.0x is strong.
**Status:** UNVERIFIABLE
- No specific academic or consulting source found establishing these thresholds.
- The MIT Sloan Management Review mentions cost-to-price ratios below 0.25 as indicating bundling potential, which is a different metric.
**Action:** Mark as "practitioner guidance" -- these are reasonable heuristics but not externally validated benchmarks. Reword as "Industry practitioners generally consider BVR >1.5x as adequate and >2.0x as strong, though optimal ratios depend on category and competitive context."

### Disney+ Bundle: 59% less likely to churn
**Claim:** Disney+ bundle (Disney+/Hulu/ESPN+) subscribers 59% less likely to churn than standalone.
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Source:** Ampere Analysis research, published by Next TV and The Media Leader.
**URL:** https://www.nexttv.com/news/disney-bundlers-59-less-likely-to-churn-research-company-says-chart
**Detail:** 70% of standalone Disney+ subscribers re-churned in 12 months vs. 29% of bundle subscribers.

### Multi-product customers: 25-35% lower churn
**Claim:** Multi-product bundled customers exhibit 25-35% lower churn.
**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED
- The range is widely cited in bundling literature but no single definitive source.
- Prince & Greenstein (2014) found a modest effect (~0.78 years longer retention for fixed broadband).
- Disney+ bundle data shows 59% reduction (much higher than 25-35%).
- Deloitte cites "up to 40% higher retention" from personalized bundling.
**Action:** Keep the 25-35% range as conservative estimate with note: "Churn reduction varies significantly by industry and bundle design, with documented cases ranging from modest (5-15%) to dramatic (50%+)."

### Retention vs. acquisition cost: 6-7x
**Claim:** Acquiring new customers costs 6-7x more than retaining existing ones.
**Status:** VERIFIED (range varies)
**Source:** Multiple sources including Signal Mind, various marketing analytics firms.
**URL (HBR version):** https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers
**Note:** HBR states "5 to 25 times more expensive." The 6-7x figure falls within this range but is not the canonical HBR number. More accurate: "5-25x more expensive to acquire than retain (HBR)."

### Value perception drop: 15% after unmet expectations
**Claim:** Research found 15% drop in perceived value when bundle promises are unmet.
**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED
- The 15% figure appears in hospitality/travel bundle research about all-inclusive packages.
- Not from a single canonical source; multiple secondary references.
**Action:** Keep as "Research in hospitality found a ~15% perceived value drop when bundle promises were unmet." Note the domain (hospitality, not universal).

### Personalized experiences: 30% retention boost
**Claim:** Personalized experiences boost retention by 30%.
**Status:** CORRECTED
- McKinsey research shows 10-15% revenue lift from personalization, and 10-30% marketing ROI improvement.
- Specific examples: Nike NikePlus 40% retention increase, Spotify 40% retention increase.
- The "30%" figure is not directly attributable to a single source.
**Action:** Replace with "McKinsey research shows personalization drives 10-15% revenue lift and 10-30% marketing ROI improvement." For retention specifically, cite examples rather than a single number.
**URL:** https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying

### Over-provisioning: 20-30% recoverable costs
**Claim:** Over-provisioning accounts for 20-30% of recoverable costs.
**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED
- Telecom Expense Management sources cite 20-45% savings from waste elimination.
- Cloud infrastructure sources cite 30-40% waste from over-provisioning.
- The 20-30% range is conservative and plausible but not precisely sourced.
**Action:** Keep as "industry analysis suggests 20-30% of feature/service costs may be wasted on capabilities customers do not value." Note it applies broadly to any feature-rich product.

---

## 4. Financial and Customer Metrics

### NPS: Industry average 15-25 for telecom
**Claim:** Telecom industry NPS average is 15-25.
**Status:** CORRECTED
- CustomerGauge and SurveySensum data show telecom NPS at approximately 29-30 for 2023-2024.
- Telecom is consistently among the lowest NPS industries but the range is closer to 25-35, not 15-25.
**Action:** Correct to "Telecom industry NPS averages approximately 29-30 (among the lowest across industries)." In generalized methodology, note that NPS benchmarks vary enormously by industry.
**URL:** https://customergauge.com/benchmarks/blog/telecommunications-nps-benchmarks-and-cx-trends

### CLV: Premium 2-4x base
**Claim:** Premium subscribers CLV should be 2-4x base.
**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED
- One source cites "VIP subscribers have 3x the lifetime value of basic tier."
- The 2-4x range is reasonable for premium vs. base tiers in subscription businesses.
- No single definitive benchmark source found.
**Action:** Keep as "premium customers typically have 2-4x the lifetime value of base customers" but mark as "practitioner target" rather than research-backed benchmark.

### CAC payback: <6 months
**Claim:** Premium CAC should be recoverable in <6 months.
**Status:** UNVERIFIABLE as universal benchmark
- CAC payback varies enormously by industry: SaaS targets 12-18 months, consumer apps target 1-3 months, telecom varies.
**Action:** Mark as "calibrate per industry." Remove <6 months as universal target.

### Time to break-even: 6-18 months
**Claim:** Premium products should break even in 6-18 months.
**Status:** UNVERIFIABLE as universal benchmark
- Reasonable range for many subscription products but not externally benchmarked.
**Action:** Keep as "practitioner guidance" with note that range varies by industry and investment level.

### Churn reduction impact: 25-35%
**Claim:** Premium tier should deliver 25-35% churn reduction.
**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED -- see Section 3 above. Range is reasonable but not precisely sourced.

### Content/partner cost ratio: <30% of premium revenue delta
**Claim:** Partner/licensing costs should be <30% of premium revenue delta.
**Status:** UNVERIFIABLE
- No external source found for this specific threshold.
**Action:** Mark as "practitioner guidance." Reasonable heuristic but industry-specific.

### Penetration rate target: 10-25% of eligible base
**Claim:** Mature premium tier should achieve 10-25% penetration of eligible base.
**Status:** UNVERIFIABLE as universal benchmark
- Reasonable for telecom premium tiers.
- SaaS freemium-to-paid: 2-5%. Mobile apps: 3-5%.
**Action:** Mark "calibrate per industry." The range is plausible for established subscription products.

### Freemium conversion: 3-5% (apps), 2-5% (SaaS), 5-15% (telecom upsell)
**Claim:** Various freemium/conversion benchmarks.
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Source:** First Page Sage 2026 report, Geneo benchmarks, multiple SaaS analytics sources.
**URL:** https://firstpagesage.com/seo-blog/saas-freemium-conversion-rates/
**Detail:** Self-serve freemium: 3-5% average; sales-assisted: 5-7%; top performers: 8-15%.

### Feature utilization target: >60%
**Claim:** >60% of features should be used by >60% of customers.
**Status:** UNVERIFIABLE
- Reasonable product management heuristic but no specific research source found.
**Action:** Keep as "practitioner target" -- widely used in product management but not externally validated.

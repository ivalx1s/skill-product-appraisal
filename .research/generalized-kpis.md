## KPI Mapping: Telecom -> Universal

| VAS revenue share | Service/add-on revenue share | VAS = Value-Added Services (telecom term) |
| Ecosystem revenue share | Ecosystem revenue share | Already universal enough |
| Prepaid/postpaid ARPU gap | *Removed* | Billing model specific to telecom |
| Content engagement (KION hours) | Component engagement rate | Generalized from specific product to any component |
| Device attachment rate | *Removed* | Hardware-specific, not universal |
| Priority support resolution time | Support experience delta | Kept but generalized name |
| Mobile data CAGR | Market growth rate (CAGR) | Generalized from mobile data to any market |

## Calibration Notes

The following thresholds are marked "calibrate per industry" because telecom benchmarks do not transfer directly:

| KPI | Telecom Benchmark | Why It Needs Calibration |
|-----|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Revenue uplift | +12-18% blended | SaaS may see 50-100%+ uplift from premium; physical goods may see 10-20% |
| NPS target | >30 premium; 15-25 industry avg | NPS benchmarks: tech/SaaS ~40-60; retail ~50-70; financial services ~20-40; healthcare ~30-50 |
| Service/add-on revenue share | >15% | Varies enormously: SaaS services ~30-60%; retail add-ons ~5-15% |
| Affordability threshold | <3-5% of income | Telecom = essential utility; luxury goods, enterprise SaaS, etc. have different budget share norms |
| Conversion rates (freemium) | 5-15% telecom upsell | Mobile apps 3-5%; SaaS 2-5%; gaming 1-2% |
| Price elasticity | -0.43 to -1.10 | Highly industry-specific; food ~-0.3, luxury ~-0.5 to -1.5, SaaS ~-1.0 to -2.0 |
